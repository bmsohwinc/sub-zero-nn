# Using Tensorflow JS

## Tutorials
1. Making predictions from 2-D data: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-regression/index.html#1
2. Handwritten digit recognitions: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-classfication/index.html#1

## Setup
1. You can follow the guidelines in the above tutorials
2. You might face CORS error when loading local files.
3. Then, setup a simple local Python file server as given in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/set_up_a_local_testing_server
4. Now, open the `index.html` file using `http://localhost:8000` instead of directly opening by double-clicking the file from File Explorer
    - We are moving from `file://` to `http://` mode to avoid CORS errors
5.
